    <h2>Welcome to the Python User Group in Princeton</h2>
    <p>
    The Python User Group in Princeton (PUG-IP) is a friendly and diverse group of
    programmers of all levels and backgrounds, bound together by a passion for
    elegant code and an interest in Python as one way to achieve that goal. The
    group participates in and hosts various educational and community outreach
    events.

      <h2>This Site</h2>
      <p>The pugip.org site is a collaborative effort among any members who care to be
      involved. It's a way for members to stretch their wings and work with things we
      might not otherwise get our hands on. It's fun! Stay tuned here for future
      developments. We collaborate via <a href="http://github.com/pugip">a github
      organization</a>, and deploy to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>
